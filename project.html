    <h1>Harvest Innovations</h1>
    <p>With a fast-track project in mind, Harvest Innovations hired DSC and ATURA architecture to get started right away on two new product lines. Harvest Innovations is a manufacturer of non-GMO chemically free, gluten free and organic food ingredients used by some of the largest food manufacturers in North America. Now their product line has expanded as DSC helped them add two non-soy process lines into their production facility in Indianola, Iowa. In order to meet the demands of soy-allergens, these lines had to be contained to their own separate rooms with 4-inch insulated metal wall panels, new air handling ventilation systems, and structural tube steel mezzanines for the equipment to sit on.

        Our crews started this project by going out to a plant in Illinois, taking apart existing equipment, and then bringing it back to Harvest Innovation facilities in Indianola and Deshler, Ohio. They then set the equipment into the two rooms they created in Indianola. One room, referred to as the grinding room, is 1,500 SF and the other room, the extrusion room, is 2,500 SF. They also put in new dust collection systems for both lines.</p>
<h1>Putting a safe, sustainable and flexible toolbox into the hands of farmers  </h1>
<p>Farmers of all sizes in all agricultural systems must meet the needs and expectations of food processors and retailers, consumers, society and our planet.

    Crop protection is one of the world’s most highly regulated industries. To gain and maintain registration, a chemical must be shown to be safe for workers, the environment, crops and consumers.
    
    Syngenta is a world market leader in crop protection products, offering farmers an extensive toolbox of solutions. We develop and produce herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and seed treatment products that promote strong and healthy growth.
    
    Our products and solutions protect crops and enhance the ability of plants to defend themselves. They can be based on world-class chemistry or naturally occurring substances and processes (biocontrols). We bring these together with new monitoring techniques, precision application, fast-developing digital technologies and new breeding techniques.
    
    Whatever the solution, we take our responsibilities seriously when it comes to making each one safe and sustainable for farmers, the whole of society and the planet.</p>
<h1>Innovating crop protection for the future</h1>
<p>Protecting crops means investing significantly in research and development. We don’t find active ingredients by chance. We design them and it can take 8 to 10 years to reach commercial launch.

    Pests and diseases are a constantly evolving threat, and the changing environment makes it even harder for farmers to grow their crops. So, we’re accelerating the pace of our innovation to meet constantly changing natural threats and society’s increasing expectations.
    
    Whether we design a breakthrough ‘blockbuster’ molecule or develop an active ingredient for a specific purpose, our product development is driven by scientific insights gained by working closely with farmers in the field. We include safety and sustainability criteria from the very beginning.
    
    To create successful solutions, we need diversity of ideas and expertise. We don’t work alone but have collaborations with many partners such as universities, research institutes and sustainable agriculture experts.</p>    
<h1>Syngenta Crop Protection keeps plants safe from planting to harvesting</h1>
<p>From the moment a seed is planted through to harvest, crops need to be protected from weeds, insects and diseases as well as droughts and floods, heat and cold.

    As a world market leader in crop protection, we help farmers to counter these threats and ensure enough safe, nutritious, affordable food for all – while minimizing the use of land and other agricultural inputs.</p>
